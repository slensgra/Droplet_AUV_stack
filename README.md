This codebase was developed to support the Droplet autonomous underwater assembly robot. 
The framework was used to achieve the first example of free-floating autonomous underwater construction and supported field deployments!

If you are interested in my thoughts on the full development process, check out my blog posts at https://www.samlensgraf.com

Examples of it in action:
