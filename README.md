# Code stack for the Droplet underwater assembly robot.

This codebase was developed to support the Droplet autonomous underwater assembly robot. 
The framework was used to achieve the first example of free-floating autonomous underwater construction and supported field deployments!

If you are interested in my thoughts on the full development process, check out my blog posts at https://www.samlensgraf.com

Examples of it in action:
